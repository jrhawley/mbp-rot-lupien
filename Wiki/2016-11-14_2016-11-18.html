===Element identification===
This was actually pretty straightforward. In this repo I've created the ElementID Perl script to handle the process for identifying DNA elements. Currently it can test for chromatin loop anchors based on CTCF motifs, and promoters based on their proximity to TSSs from the gencode reference file.

===Refactoring MuSE===
I'm putting the final touches on MuSE while I'm in this rotation. I've refactored a bit more, and I've implemented proper directory structure. There's one issue of incorrect cleanup that I'll have to fix tomorrow, but other than that, everything looks good.
