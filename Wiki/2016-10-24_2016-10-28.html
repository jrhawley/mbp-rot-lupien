==Oct 24 - Oct 28, 2016==
===C3D Results===
Its initial run completed and produced <abbr title="Browser Extensible Data">BED</abbr> files and <code>signalMatrix.txt</code>. Tahmid said that this allows for faster runs after the first pass. It failed though, running <code>c3d.R</code> becuase it couldn't find <code>JASPAR_IDs.txt</code>, which the R script assumes is in the same directory. I'm rerunning C3D via <code>sh c3d_wrapper.sh 79_BCa_samples_rec.cfg</code> to properly reference the JASPAR file.

====Mistakes were made====
Even if C3D hadn't crashed at the Rscript, it would've taken weeks to run, because I accidentally used the unmerged/unsorted anchor file. That has been corrected in the config files.

I also ended up corrupting the output files when trying to rerun. I still have the original signalMatrix.txt and most of the reference BEDs, but I think a few of them were overwritten.

To fix these mistakes, I've made 8 different folders, each containing a portion of the merged/sorted anchor file. It's a poor man's parallelization implementation, but given the current state of C3D I think it's appropriate. Parallelizing it would require an entire rewrite of the code with lots of abstraction. I think it's necessary, just not for me and not right now.

====Rerunning scripts====
It took 6.5h to map the BED files, and about 3h for the Rscript to parse 1000 anchors. Given that I'm restarting the mapping on all 8 sets, and each set contains 8236 anchors, it should take around 30h to complete. That translates to finishing at 22:00 on 2016-10-25.

Turns out I forgot to modify the config files for sections 3-7. So those failed entering the Rscript. In order to avoid potentially corrupting the data again, I made copies of the directories, fixed the config files, then ran the scripts again. So they should finish sometime tomorrow (2016-10-26).

This finally worked. I copied all the resulting files into <code>20161026_C3D</code>, and formatted the files for input to MuSE via (replace <code>$i</code> with each number):

<pre>
cat results_$i.txt | awk -v OFS='\t' '{if (NR!=1) {print $1, $4, $7, $7, $8}}' > results_$i.formatted.txt
cat results_*.formatted.txt >> results_all.txt
</pre>

===C3D Recommendations===
C3D is a script in its early stages. It requires a lot of code cleanup, and could do with adhering to some standard practices. Here are some things to do in the future to make the script better:
# No config file
#* Making config files and running scripts can get messy, since it requires writing to a config file every time you want to run the script
#* Using command line args is likely a better way to implement this, especially for making a pipeline
# Using getopt/standard argparsing
#* Will make it easier to parse arguments without the need for a config file
#* Lessen chance of making mistakes when running
# Rewrite in Python or Perl
#* Bash is useful, but not as readable or supported for many of these things
#* MuSE already uses perl, so it would be easier to make this an entire library
#* Calculations, command line, and parallelization are easily supported in these languages
#* This would likely take some time to do, unfortunately
# Parallelization
#* These scripts take a long time to run
#* Using perl or python packages to parallelize computations will significantly speed up processing time
# Check files and folders before executing
#* Nothing sucks more than having your script run for a few hours just to have it crash because you forgot to check that a directory or file existed
# Comments
#* Please put comments all over the place in the code
#* Takes a lot of time to understand what's going on without them
#* "You will spend much more time looking at and reviewing your code than you will writing it"

===Running MuSE===
Looking at the <code>simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.tsv.gz</code> file Sven pointed me towards, I'm using that, plus the C3D results from before to look at significant regions. I need to format the TSV for MuSE to read it properly. To do that, I ran:

<pre>
# collect the appropriate columns, prepend "chr" to chromosome column, remove headers
zcat simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.tsv.gz | awk -F "\t" 'BEGIN{OFS="\t";} {$9 = "chr" $9; if (NR != 1) {print $9, $10, $11, $7, $16, $17}}' > simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.bed
# sort BED file
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.bed > simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.sorted.bed
</pre>

I then ran MuSE as follows:

<pre>
qsub run-MuSE.sh /mnt/work1/users/lupiengroup/hawleyj/Data/simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.sorted.bed results_all.formatted.txt /mnt/work1/users/lupiengroup/hawleyj/Data/wgEncodeUwDnaseMcf7HotspotsRep1.broadPeak 500000 0.7
</pre>

To filter out duplicate mutations, sort with the unique option:

<pre>
sort -u -k1,1 -k2,2n simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.bed > simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.sorted.unique.bed
qsub run-MuSE.sh /mnt/work1/users/lupiengroup/hawleyj/Data/simple_somatic_mutation.open.BRCA-EU.sorted.unique.bed results_all.formatted.txt /mnt/work1/users/lupiengroup/hawleyj/Data/wgEncodeUwDnaseMcf7HotspotsRep1.broadPeak 500000 0.7
</pre>

I'm getting a lot of errors running this. I'm still getting output, but I don't know what these errors entail, so I want to track them down before I do a complete run again, since they took a few hours (3 for the non-unique, and 4.5 for the unique mutation files). I'm getting errors like:

<pre>

I think it has to do with improper line splitting. Perl doesn't have rigid types, so writing expressions doesn't usually cause a problem until you don't correctly format your inputs. I'll investigate that now.

I was right. The string was only being split by <code>:</code> instead of both <code>:</code> and <code>-</code>, on lines 335 and 336 of MuSE 1.6. I've corrected this in the latest version.
